Annotation API is a backend service to store and retrieve annotations.

## Quickstart.
#### To clone repo and prepare to pull containers:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmcts/em-annotation-app.git
cd em-annotation-app/
brew install jq
```

There are two methods to start the containers and run the application. 

Method 1 is the recommended option for improved performance and debugging.
Method 2 is currently maintained for support.

#### To start the docker containers:

Method 1:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dependencies-db.yml pull
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dependencies-db.yml up
```

Method 2:
```
./bin/start-local-environment.sh
```
#### Clean and build for both methods:
```
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build
```

#### Run below command to setup the db for both methods:
```
./gradlew migratePostgresDatabase
```

#### To start the application:

Method 1:
```
./gradlew bootWithCCD
```

Method 2:
```
./gradlew bootRun
```

#### To remove docker containers after stopping the run:
Method 1:
```
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q)
```

Method 2:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dependencies.yml down
```

#### Potential issues and solutions
Port 5000 is already in use on Monterey macs:

Disable AirPlay receiver

Authentication issues causing containers to not start:
```
docker logout hmctspublic.azurecr.io
```

### Swagger UI
To view our REST API go to http://{HOST}/swagger-ui/index.html
On local machine with server up and running, link to swagger is as below
> http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
> if running on AAT, replace localhost with ingressHost data inside values.yaml class in the necessary component, making sure port number is also removed.

### API Endpoints
A list of our endpoints can be found here
> https://hmcts.github.io/reform-api-docs/specs/rpa-em-annotation-app.json

### Running contract or pact tests:

You can run contract or pact tests as follows:
```
./gradlew clean
```

```
./gradlew contract
```

You can then publish your pact tests locally by first running the pact docker-compose:

```
docker-compose -f docker-pactbroker-compose.yml up
```


and then using it to publish your tests:

```
./gradlew pactPublish
```
